## üëã Welcome visitor

We are building free open source tools to secure the **Node.js** & **JavaScript** ecosystem. Our biggest area of expertise is in **package and code analysis**.

We are mainly developers who like to build tools that bring you value for free ‚ù§Ô∏è. Our tools often provide a range of benefits and information such as:
- Non opinionated metrics (On quality and maintainability).
- Very useful information about the projects you use (SPDX license conformance for example).
- The different security threats within your codes

Our tools have proven to be of great use to rigorous developers and package maintainers. But there is still a long way to go to make our tools more accessible to beginners üí™.

It doesn't necessarily matter if you are a beginner in security or not. Many projects require skills that are not directly related to security. So don't feel illegitimate to come and contribute and learn.
