## 👋 Welcome visitor

We are building free open source tools to secure the **Node.js** & **JavaScript** ecosystem. Our biggest area of expertise is in **package and code analysis** (SCA).

We are mainly developers who like to build tools that bring you value for free ❤️. Our tools often provide a range of benefits and information such as:
- Non opinionated metrics (On quality and maintainability).
- Very useful information about the projects you use:
  - OpenSSF [Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/).
  - [SPDX](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/Concise-Guide-for-Developing-More-Secure-Software.md#readme) license conformance.
  - Vulnerabilities (with support of multiple strategies: NPM, Sonatype, Snyk).
- The different security threats within your codes (detected using our open source SAST [JS-X-Ray](https://github.com/NodeSecure/js-x-ray)).

Our tools have proven to be of great use to rigorous developers and package maintainers. But there is still a long way to go to make our tools more accessible to beginners 💪.

### ❤️ Contributors
We welcome new contributors. Please feel free to join us on Discord and help on the different projects.

It doesn't necessarily matter if you are a beginner in security or not. Many projects require skills that are not directly related to security. So **don't feel illegitimate** to come and contribute and learn.
