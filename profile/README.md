## 👋 Welcome visitor

We are building free open source tools to securize the **Node.js** & **JavaScript** ecosystem. Our biggest area of expertise is in **package and code analysis**.

We are mainly developers who like to build tools that bring you value for free ❤️. Our tools often provide a range of benefits and information such as:
- Non opinionated metrics (On quality and maintainability).
- Very useful information about the projects you use (SPDX license conformance for example).
- The different security threats within your codes

Our tools have proven to be of great use to rigorous developers and package maintainers. But there is still a long way to go to make our tools more accessible to beginners 💪.

### ❤️ Contributors
We welcome new contributors. Please feel free to contact us (`fraxken#8064` on [discord](https://discord.com/)) and help on the different projects.

It doesn't necessarily matter if you are a beginner in security or not. Many projects require skills that are not directly related to security. So don't feel illegitimate to come and contribute and learn.

> Note: We are looking for people to help us with UI/UX design.
